## 🛠️ How it Works

The Telegram Guardian Bot leverages the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library to interact with the Telegram API. After setting up the bot with your Telegram API token, you can configure its behavior using a `config.json` file and commands in the chat.

1. **Authentication:** Provide your Telegram bot token.
2. **Configuration:** Set up your `config.json` file with the necessary settings.
3. **Run the Bot:** Start the bot and let it manage your group.
